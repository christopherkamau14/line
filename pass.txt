First Create a database called school

Install Tomcat9.exe in your machine if its not present

Place the SchoolProj.war file in tomcat's webapp folder

Then from services start Tomcat and give it a minute to run

On your browser hit 'localhost:8080/SchoolProj/login'

insert 'user' into field user_name in db and password insert '$2y$12$F2wXy0mcYmm8VJa75DEAT.PaSoo7zZZuoFDfwOW.24zRKzK92n6uu' for spring security hashing from
the backend.

To login use user as username and user as password spring with automatically unhash that weird hash string into user and you will login
